## Data Storage

Most of the computes are done on Google Colab and the data are stored on Google Drive.
For replication, the `/data` folder should be mounted from Google Drive via [this link](https://shorturl.at/dhrIL).


## Credits

For steering vector analysis, we revised code from [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) and [algebraic_value_editing](https://github.com/montemac/algebraic_value_editing).
